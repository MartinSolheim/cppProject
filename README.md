### Crypto currency portfolio in Qt Creator as a final project for the course "Efficient coding in C and C++" at Oslo Metropolitan University 2018

* Fetches the current 15 biggest crypto currencies based on market cap.
* Updates the values/profit/graph every 2 minutes.
* Calculates your profit/loss.
* Shows a graph of percent changes the last 24 hours.
* Graph scales to the most extreme positive or negative value

Could use some UI improvements, but Qt Creator is too clunky to bother.
